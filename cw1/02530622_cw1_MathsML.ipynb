In statistical learning, an overfit model may be seen as a complex explanation compared to a (plausible)standard fit model, hence we should pick the latter. It applies to naturally occuring images as inputs to a model. An overfit model would be able to label an image from its training set, but if we alter the image slightly, it'd probably give an incorrect label. That is a problem because in the natural world, images with the same label can be varied (e.g. a picture of a panda and a slightly noisy picture of a panda). Hence, we should follow Occam's razor and choose the simple model for processing of natural images."

Our trajectory is seeking the minimum loss value, i.e. descending as much as possible. A big learning rate would be helpful in descending big and wide valleys, as it is making \"big leaps\" in the landscape. But as the trajectory descends, the valleys diameter would grow smaller (we increase the resolution, or zooming in). So a big learning rate would make the trajectory jump over and miss the valley instead of going into it. Decaying the learning rate would make the trajectory take small steps towards the valley, and therefore entering it.\n",

This is not likely due to overfitting because the training loss did not improve. Instead, I suspect that this is because the loss landscape becomes very complex for each additional hidden layer, hence finding the optimum is harder (as stated in the lecture).\n",
        "\n",
        "Hence, I lowered the learning rate to `lr=0.0005`. Then, we see that up to around `depth=7` we get lower train loss, which indicates that the optimum is found. After that, the train loss sharply increases, which probably means that the optimum is not found.\n",

        "We can also notice quite an obvious overfitting behaviour for the test loss. From `depth=3` and onwards, the test loss increases regardless of the train loss. Which means that the network is learning to imitate the train dataset instead of generalizing. Therefore, the optimal depth for these hyperparameters is probably `depth=3`."

        "The scaling makes sense because we want to employ the Central Limit Theorm on $f_i^{(2)}(x)$. CLT states that the sum of $N$ i.i.d r.v. $X_i, ... ,X_N $ with mean and variance $\\mu, \\sigma^2$ distributes (approx.) as $\\mathcal{N}(N \\mu, N \\sigma^2)$. In our case, the mean $\\mathbb{E}[f_i^{(2)}]=0$, and the variance depends on the variance of the wieghts $w_{ij}^{(2)}$ (more details below). Then, in order to keep the variance from diverging as $N_1 \\rightarrow \\infty$  while applying CLT, we have to normalize the variance of the wieghts by $N_1$."
