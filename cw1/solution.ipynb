In statistical learning, an overfit model may be seen as a complex explanation compared to a (plausible)standard fit model, hence we should pick the latter. It applies to naturally occuring images as inputs to a model. An overfit model would be able to label an image from its training set, but if we alter the image slightly, it'd probably give an incorrect label. That is a problem because in the natural world, images with the same label can be varied (e.g. a picture of a panda and a slightly noisy picture of a panda).

In the lanscape (i.e. loss values over $n$-dimensional parameter space), we might have many dips and valleys of diffrent sizes, shapes, and slopes. Our trajectory is seeking the minimum loss value, i.e. descending as much as possible. A big learning rate would be helpful in descending big and wide valleys, as it is making \"big leaps\" in the landscape. But as the trajectory descends, the valleys diameter would grow smaller (we increase the resolution, or zooming in). So a big learning rate would make the trajectory jump over and miss the valley instead of going into it. Decaying the learning rate would make the trajectory take small steps towards the valley, and therefore entering it.\n",
